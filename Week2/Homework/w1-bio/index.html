    <!-- Bio Section few facts about me -->
    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
    <p>
        My name is <b>Zachary Costa-Mello</b> my brithday is Oct/17/1997 at the time of writing this I'm 27 soon to be 28. 
        I spent a few years in the <strong>Air Force</strong>, those years are probably the most important to who I am as a person now and I miss being in the service.
        I spend <em>most of my free</em> time reading, playing MTG, or in my video games. I tend to play a wide mix of games from RPGs, strategy, shooters, survival, almost anything that catches my eye.
        Now I spend <i>most of my time over all</i> between school and school work, I'm going for a batchlor in Cybersecurity.
        For a very short time I used to stram on Twitch and this is one of my favorite clips that came from me on a friends channel we were playing <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/AdorableReliableSwallowDoggo-7lK7op8WjP8FFfsR" target="_blank">Hunt Showdown</a>.
        That clip was from about 3:30am for me so I was more gremlin then human. I tend to just go with the flow when I can it makes life much easier then to always end up in fights or take things too seriously.
