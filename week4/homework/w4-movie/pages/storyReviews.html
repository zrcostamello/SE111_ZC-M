        <h2>REVIEW</h2>

        <div>
            <p><b>Zachary Costa-Mello</b><i> Oct 25,2025</i><br><br>
            <em>The NeverEnding Story</em> is a fantasy film that blends childhood wonder with deeper themes of courage, <b>loss</b>, and imagination. 
            The story follows Bastian, a lonely boy who escapes into the magical land of Fantasia by reading a mysterious book. 
            As he becomes immersed in Atreyu’s quest to save the Childlike Empress from the destructive force called The Nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
            <em>The NeverEnding Story</em> creates a sense of wonder created through its practical effects and set design. 
            From Falkor the luckdragon’s comforting smile to the dark menace of Gmork, the world of Fantasia feels tangible and alive. 
            The movie never shies away from heavier emotions such as grief and fear, making it more than just a children’s tale. 
            Its mix of melancholy, hope, and <em>pain</em> that resonates with audiences of all ages.

                        Trivia 
                    </h2>    
                 <h3>       
                     <b>1.</b> At the time of its release it was the most expensive 
                        film produced outside the United States and the Soviet Union.<br><br>
                     
                    <b>2.</b> Michael Ende, the author of the book, was initially very enthusiastic that his book was going to be turned into 
                    a film, and he also worked with Wolfgang Petersen as a script advisor. However, during production, he strongly disagreed 
                    with how the film deviated from the source material, and he demanded his name to be removed from the opening credits 
                    (he is still mentioned in the ending credits). Ende later requested a change of the film's title or that production halted altogether. 
                    After the studio declined both requests, he filed a lawsuit and ultimately lost. <br><br>   

                    <b>3.</b> Noah Hathaway has said that when appearing at fan conventions, he has put out baskets of dollar bills. He invites anyone 
                    to take a dollar if they've had to undergo therapy after watching the Swamps of Sadness scene, in which Atreyu's horse Artax dies. 
                    The scene has traumatized generations of children, and thousands have commented on social media about the experience
